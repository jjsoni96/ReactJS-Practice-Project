# ReactJS-Practice-Project
This repository is created to showcase the work done while learning ReactJS and Redux. The work done on both is quite basic and it was done with the help of various tutorials available on YouTube.

To run these projects, NodeJS should be installed on the system. 

Installation Overview(For Windows)
Installing Node.js® and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the Node.js web site.

* Installation Steps
  1) Download the Windows installer from Nodejs.org. 
  2) Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
  3) Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings). 
  4) Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.


Installation for ReactJS(Windows)
  1) Open Command Prompt where the Project is cloned
  2) npm install -g create-react-app
  3) cd <project-name>
  4) npm start
